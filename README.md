Coded as a personal project in Eclipse, designed to be run in Eclipse as well under the project name "Trivia".  Meant as a way to test connecting Java with a public API.

No longer being updated.

Complied and packaged into 'app.jar' for simplicity of running, though visual bugs are evident in this version specifically.

Known issue of not formatting TriviaDB's response (e.g "\&pi;" instead of "&pi;")
Known issue of response text not fitting into boxes
